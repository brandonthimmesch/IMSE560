    "We can see that both methods provide results that match the solution found using solver in Excel. You may think the advanced model is overly complicated, but storing your constraint information in a data structure (such as a list, array, or pandas dataframe) will help you create more robust, future-proof models that will be easier to modify in case any provided information changes. Additionally, referencing these arrays by their indices will help you create simplified model formulations that makes use of combinatorial notation such as X_ij (for i belonging to set I, for j belonging to set J).\n",
